            <h2>History</h2>
            

            <p>Founded in 1990 by a group of friends passionate about whitewater, Fast Rafting has experienced an incredible trajectory over the years. Starting with a simple idea to offer river rafting descents, the founders were able to turn their passion into a thriving business that now brings joy to thousands of customers.</p>

            <p>It all began when these adventure-loving friends discovered the joys of rafting during a trip to the United States. Captivated by the adrenaline rush and the beauty of the landscapes, they decided to bring this activity to France and share it with as many people as possible.</p>

            <p>Today, Fast Rafting has become a reference in the world of rafting in the United States. Thanks to its team of passionate and experienced guides, the company guarantees its clients exceptional moments, combining thrills, breathtaking scenery, and team spirit.</p>

            <p>From the Rogue River to the Rogue River, and many other rivers in between, Fast Rafting has written a wonderful story, that of a successful human and entrepreneurial adventure. Proud of its origins and its know-how, the company continues to offer its clients unforgettable experiences at the heart of the whitewater.</p>
