            <p>Hello! My name is Andrianasy Lahimpagnahy. I come from Madagascar and I love computer science. As a passionate web developer, I am currently honing my skills in web design and development through the WDD 130 course. I enjoy creating engaging and user-friendly websites, and I'm particularly interested in enhancing user experiences through thoughtful design and functionality. When I'm not coding, I love exploring the beautiful landscapes of my homeland and learning about the latest advancements in technology. I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you! Besides web development, I have a keen interest in other fields of technology such as cybersecurity. I spend my free time reading about new tech trends, experimenting with different programming languages, and participating in online coding challenges. Additionaly, I am an avid traveler, and I take every opportunity to discover new places and cultures, which greatly inspires my work. I believe in continuous learning and always strive to expand my knowledge and skills. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded individuals and contributing to meaningful projects. Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
